This variation in values is variance. When variance is observed, the next step is to determine what the factors are between the variance - in other words, what factors are responsible for the difference in height between the 100 people? Gender is likely an important consideration - as males tend to be taller on average. But is that the only reason some people are taller or shorter than others? Maybe ethnicity is influencing this variance - some ethnic groups are naturally taller than others. Genetics might also contribute; as taller parents typically have taller children.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Redundancy\n",
    "Be careful with including multiple variables that show similar information. For example, if you have a variable \"Hours of Study\" which represents the total hours that a student studied, and you've also binned that data and created a new variable \"Study Level\" which groups students into \"high, med, low\" - you now have two variables in your dataset that show similar information, although one variable is a lot more specific. When you have this situation, you should elect to keep the variable that has the more detailed information (i.e. the specific hours of study). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Groups\n",
    "Variables with a lot of different levels (i.e. State of Residence) don't do well in regression models. If you have a variable that has a large number of different groups, unless this variable is vital to your analyses, you should work to reduce the number of overall groups (i.e State can become Region), or leave the variable out of the analyses. It is possible to include these complicated variables, but it isn't always the easiest interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confounding Variables\n",
    "When we preform regression analyses, we are interested in further understanding the relationship between the dependent and independent variable. Simply put, we are interested in investigating how the independent variable effects the dependent variable. However, it's rarely this simple and there are other factors that need to be understood and controlled. A confounding variable is a third variable that influences both the independent and dependent variable to some degree. It is important to acknowledge this third variable to ensure that the results of your analyses are valid. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you collect data on sunburns and ice cream consumption. You find that higher ice cream consumption is associated with a higher rate of sunburns. Does this mean that eating ice cream causes sunburns? Absolutely not, there are several other factors that can be attributed to this trend -- but most likely, the confounding variable is temperature. Hot temperatures cause people to eat more ice cream and result in people spending more time outdoors, which can result in more sunburns. Without accounting for the confounding variable(s), you may find relationships between variables that might not actually exist. To control for the potential effects of confounding variables, you simply have to include them in your regression model as another independent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you include all of your assumed confounding variables in your regression model, you are controlling for the effects of all of them, and if you find there is still a relationship between a specific independent variable and your dependent variable, you will know that relationship isn't being influenced by any of these other factors."

When you are creating a multiple linear regression equation, the formula is similar - with some added features: <b> y = b + (m1 x X1) + (m2 x X2) + (m3 x X3) + ....etc. </b> where each \"m x X\" is representative of one of the coefficients in your model, and \"b\" represents the intercept. Once you have your regression output, you can plug these values in to make predictions on your dependent variable given specific values for your independent variables.\n",
